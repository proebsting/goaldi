[[Building]]
Installing Goaldi from Source
-----------------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build Goaldi you must first install the Go programming language.

Get Go from http://golang.org/doc/install[golang.org], install it, and
add it to your search path.
For a standard installation you’ll probably add /usr/local/go/bin to $PATH.

Create a work area for Go builds and define it in your environment as $GOPATH.
For example:
----
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
mkdir $GOPATH $GOPATH/src
----

Updating will be easiest if you use Git to clone the source:
----
cd $GOPATH/src
git clone git://github.com/proebsting/goaldi.git
----

Alternatively, you can visit the GitHub page at
https://github.com/proebsting/goaldi[github.com/proebsting/goaldi] and click
“Download ZIP” in the right-hand sidebar.  Unpack the zip file to make
$GOPATH/src/goaldi.

Building Goaldi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add $GOPATH/bin to your search path. +
*cd* to $GOPATH/src/goaldi.

Because Goaldi is written in Goaldi, there is a bootstrapping issue.  If
an executable *goaldi* is found in the search path, perhaps from an
earlier binary install, then that will be used to build Goaldi.  If not,
run **make boot** to compile the Go portion of the system and combine it
with previously-translated Goaldi intermediate code to install a
*goaldi* executable in $GOPATH/bin.

Type *make* to build and test Goaldi from the source tree.  There are
no options. +
Type **make install** to install the newly built *goaldi* in
$GOPATH/bin.

When Goaldi is updated, you can install the new version by entering:
----
cd $GOPATH/src/goaldi
git pull
make
make install
----

Running Goaldi Programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Goaldi is a traditional programming language without a GUI.  Programs
are created using a separate editor and then run by typing **goaldi
filename.gd** optionally followed by any program arguments.  Options for
the *goaldi* command, usually not needed, are listed on the “Running
Goaldi” page.

A Goaldi program in source form can be made executable by beginning it
with
----
#!/usr/bin/env goaldi
----
as the very first line and setting the Unix “execute bit” for the file
(chmod +x filename).

Assuming that goaldi is in your search path, you can then run the
program by entering
----
./filename [arguments]
----
or it can be run via the shell search path.

Program Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no formal collection of examples yet, but you may wish to
inspect the programs in the directories gtests (used for automated
testing) and demo (not suitable for automating).

gtests/{cxprimes,primes,sieve,genqueen,queens} are small examples
converted from Icon. +
gtests/alltypes illustrates how the various Goaldi types format for
printing. +
gtests/tokenizer is an early version of the Goaldi lexer written in
Goaldi. +
demo/shuffle measures the randomness of shuffling. +

demo/{time,http} and gtests/{regex,hash32,zipreader} illustrate use of
Go library methods
(documented at http://golang.org/pkg/[golang.org/pkg]) associated with
objects returned by library procedures or the sample Goaldi extensions
that are included in the extensions directory.

By far the largest example is the Goaldi front-end itself, in the tran
directory.  This is derived, via manual conversion and extensive
editing, from the Jcon translator of Icon.

[[Running]]
Running Goaldi
--------------

Running a Goaldi program is usually as simple as just
----
goaldi filename.gd [program arguments]
----
but here is the full “man page”.  Many of the options are for the
benefit of the Goaldi developers and are not particularly useful to a
Goaldi programmer.
----
goaldi [options] filename.gd… [--] [argument…]
  –c   compile only, IR code to file.gir
  –a   compile only, IR code to file.gir, assembly to file.gia
  –l   load and link but do not execute
  –t   show CPU timings
  –A   dump assembly listing to stdout before execution
  –D   dump Go stack on panic
  –E   show initial environment
  –I   trace initialization ordering
  –N   inhibit optimization
  –P   produce ./PROFILE file (Linux)
  –T   trace IR instruction execution
----

If multiple source files are presented, they must have a .gd extension.

If the first program argument ends in .gd it must be protected by a
\-- separator argument.

Arguments are passed to main as separate parameters (unlike the single
array used in Icon).


[[GoTypes]]
Go Types in Goaldi
------------------

The Goaldi system can be extended by adding custom functions written in Go.
Many standard Go functions such as *printf* are also incorporated in
Goaldi this way.
This section explains how values are converted when crossing the
boundary between the Goaldi and Go type systems.  It applies to naïvely
written Go functions that are not specifically designed to deal with
Goaldi values.  Note that information loss is possible in either
direction; for example, Goaldi does not have 64-bit integers.

External values defined by Go functions extend the native Goaldi types.
Any unrecognized Go value is imported as an external.  These values can
provide methods that implement Goaldi operators.  A few Goaldi operators
such as field selection and indexing can be applied to external values
containing certain Go types such as arrays, maps, and structs even if no
implementing methods are supplied by the value’s underlying type.

Calling Go functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Goaldi programs can call only those Go functions that are registered
when Goaldi is built.
This is often a trivial matter; see numerous uses of GoLib in the Goaldi
source code.
When a Go function is called, arguments are converted according to the
export rules below.
If the function returns no values, nil is produced.  A single value is
returned directly.  Multiple values are returned as a Goaldi list.
(This behavior is modified for standard library procedures; for those,
a final declared error return value is either deleted if nil or thrown
as an exception if not.)

Importing Go values into Goaldi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Goaldi program imports a value from Go by calling a Go function or by
accessing an external map, struct, slice, or array.  Any Go value is
usable as a Goaldi value.

A Go value is imported by inspecting the actual value, without regard to
the declared type, and following these rules, in order:

* A Go *nil*, even a typed nil, it is converted to a Goaldi *nil*.
* A Goaldi native value is retained unmodified
* A Go object *g* that implements **goaldi.IImport** is imported by
calling **g.Import()**.
* A Go object that implements **goaldi.IExternal** is unconditionally
made *external*.
* A Go *bool* is converted into 0 for false or 1 for true.
* A Go numeric (**float32**, **uint16**, *rune*, etc.) is converted to
*number*.
* A Go *string* or **[]byte** is interpreted as UTF-8 and converted to
a *string*.
* A Go **[]rune** is converted directly to a Goaldi Unicode string.
* A Go **io.Reader** or **io.Writer** is converted to a *file*.
* Anything still unrecognized becomes an *external*.

Exporting Goaldi values to Go
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Goaldi value passed as a function argument is converted to the type
expected by the corresponding Go function parameter.

* A Go parameter of any numeric type requires a Goaldi number as an
argument, or a string convertible to number.
* A Go *string* parameter, or convertible equivalent such as
**[]byte** or **[]rune**, requires a Goaldi string or number.
* A Go *bool* parameter is passed a value of *false* iff the Goaldi
argument is **0** or *nil*.

In all others cases, the Goaldi value is converted using the following
rules:

* A Goaldi *nil* is passed as **interface{}(nil)**.
* A Goaldi *number* exports a Go **float64**.  (Use "**%.0d"** to see
integers in *printf*.)
* A Goaldi Unicode *string* is encoded in UTF-8 and passed as a Go
*string*.
* A buffered Goaldi *file* (**%stdin**, **%stdout**, or a typical file
opened by a Goaldi program) is exported without conversion.  Because a
Goaldi *file* implements *io*.*ReadWriteCloser* it can in be used
directly as a sequential file in Go.
* An unbuffered Goaldi *file* (**%stderr**, an imported file, or a
file opened without buffering) exports the underlying **io.Reader** or
**io.Writer** object.
* A Goaldi *procedure* exports **func(env *Env, args ...Value) (Value,
*Closure)**.
* A Goaldi *list* exports a copy of its the data as a slice of Goaldi
values.
* A Goaldi *set* or *table* exports the underlying Go map.
* A Goaldi *type*, *channel*, **method value**, or
*record* exports itself without conversion.
* A Goaldi *external* that implements **Export()** passes the result
of calling that method.
* Any other *external* is passed unconverted.

The same conversion rules apply when storing values in a typed field in
a Go struct, map, etc.

A Go *interface{}* type accepts any value; this is how
*printf* works.  For parameters of other types a panic occurs if the
converted argument value is not compatible.

[[Extending]]
Extending Goaldi
----------------

Here are some notes about adding Go code to the Goaldi system.  They
don’t attempt to explain the whole system; they assume you want to add
run-time functionality without changing the language.

Run-time extensions are made by adding files in the
*extensions* directory.  These follow a pattern that can be seen in
the sample extensions already present.  The simplest of these is
**extensions/zipr.go**, which adds a Zip file reader with just a single
line of code surrounded by a small amount of scaffolding.

Because the Go language does not provide any sort of dynamic loading,
any change requires rebuilding the system.  No changes to the Makefile
are needed even if more files are added to the *extensions* directory.

Most uses of Go from Goaldi, including these examples, leverage the
automatic conversions between Goaldi values and Go values as described
in an earlier section.

The simplest change: Connecting a Go function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, adding a Go library function to the Goaldi standard library
is all that’s needed.
An exercise to add a Zip file reader ended up this way, as seen in the
file **extensions/zipr.go**.
Besides the boilerplate, there is just a single line of code
encapsulated in an init function:
----
GoLib(zip.OpenReader, "zipreader", "name", "open a Zip file")
----

That line adds the Go function **zip.OpenReader** to the run-time
library under the name *zipreader*.  It takes a single argument called
*name* and is given a short description.

When the newly added procedure *zipreader* is called, it returns a
zip.ReadCloser object.  This object contains a slice of zip.File
pointers; all of these can be read by Goaldi code.  See the example in
the file **tests/zipreader.gd**.

Slightly more complex:  Adding a file of new functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example file **extensions/hash.go** is only a bit more complex. The
init() function adds five entries to the standard library.  Four of
these are imported from the Go library and one is defined in the source
file.

The added hashvalue() function makes the assumption that its argument is
a file that was created by one of the other four functions.  It works by
“converting” this to a Hash32 object using a type assertion and then
returning the result of calling the object’s Sum32 function.

An example of usage can be found in **tests/hash32.gd**.

Even more complex:  A custom interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example file **extensions/http.go** illustrates a more complex
interface.  The line that adds the *htpost* procedure shows how
multiple arguments are listed, including in this case a final variadic
argument.

This example shows how to implement the operators ***X** and **!X** for
a user-defined type.  _Further documentation is needed here._

A usage example is in **demos/http.gd**.

Adding a new first-class type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is an outline of the steps needed to add a new, fully-integrated
datatype to Goaldi.  It is more of a checklist than a detailed
instruction manual.

Most Goaldi extensions won’t need to do all this.  They can use and
transmit values that are treated by Goaldi as “external”.

This list was made while adding the Set datatype to Goaldi.
Parenthesized italic comments show, as examples, the particular choices
made as part of that process.

1.  Do the design work. Decide:

..  name, abbreviation character, and sort rank  __(Set, "S", between
lists and tables)__
..  constructor details   _(set(L) makes a set from items in list L,
which is optional)_
..  method of exporting to the Go world   _(export the underlying map)_
..  the forms string(x) and image(x) will take  __("S:n",
"set{x1,x2,...,xn}")__
..  the meaning of x.sort(i), if to be implemented  __(make a list and
sort that)__
..  runtime procedures to be added or modified   _(none)_
..  methods to be implemented  __(S.insert(x…), S.delete(x…),
..member(x))__
..  existing operators to be implemented  __(?S, !S, *S, @S)__
..  the form, precedence, and meaning of any new operators  __(++, --,
**)__

1.  Review and edit the documentation to reflect the design decisions.
Doing this early helps catch some problems while they are easier to
fix.
2.  Start editing files in the goaldi/runtime directory.  Begin by
creating a new file v__xxxxx__.go for implementing the fundamental parts
of the new type.  Model the basic structure of v__xxxxx__.go from
another existing file.

..  Make it part of “package runtime”.
..  Define the datatype to be used to implement the new type.  This
should be either a pointer type or a type that behaves as one (e.g. map
or interface).
..  Define the sort ranking in correct relation to the definitions in
other files.
..  Add a line to validate the correct implementation of ICore functions
to follow.
..  Declare a New__Xxxxx__ function for creating instances of the
datatype from Go code.
..  Define a var __Xxxxx__Type that is initialized by calling the
existing NewType function.  The arguments specify the new type’s name,
abbreviation character, sort rank, constructor procedure, method list,
global name for the constructor, constructor arglist signature, and
description.

1.  See the definition of ICore in interfaces.go, which specifies the
minimal set of methods that must be implemented for a new type.
 Implement these in v__xxxxx__.go, using the examples of other types as
guides.
2.  Create a new file f__xxxxx__.go for the procedures and methods of
the new type.   Start with an initially empty method list modeled after
those seen in other files.  Implement the constructor procedure that was
named in the NewType function call.  This function should accept a
Goaldi argument list and call the internal New__Xxxxx__ function.
3.  Verify a successful compilation at this point by running “make” in
the main directory.  Try a simple test program that constructs an
example of the new type.
4.  Implement procedures and methods in f__xxxxx__.go, testing
incrementally.
5.  Implement operators in a new file o__xxxxx__.go.
6.  For each operator that is new to Goaldi rather than overloading an
existing operator:

..  Define a Go interface in the manner exemplified in onumber.go.
..  Add a case in the interpreter in gexec/operator.go.
..  Add the operator to the Goaldi translator in gtran.

1.  Add one or more tests to the test suite.  A new test is added by
creating two files:  __xxxx__.gd for the test and __xxxx__.std for its
expected output.  A third file __xxxx__.dat can be added if a data file
is needed; it will be used as standard input when the test runs.
2.  If the new type is to be a standard type, it should join the
collection of examples in the existing test gtests/alltypes.gd.  Add an
example of the new type, check that the output is correct, and update
gtests/alltypes.std.
3.  Review and update the documentation one final time.

Coding standards in the Goaldi implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go code in the Goaldi source is formatted to Go standards as enforced by
“go fmt”.

Tabs are assumed to be set every four columns for all files.

Try to limit lines to 80 columns — not for punching on cards, but for
readability.

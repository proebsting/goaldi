This is part of the documentation for
https://github.com/proebsting/goaldi#goaldi-a-goal-directed-programming-language[The Goaldi Programming Language].

'''

This document lists the procedures and methods present in the
Goaldi standard library.
It was produced mechanically by extracting source code comments.

For each entry, the header line gives the procedure and argument names
followed by a one-line synopsis.
A procedure with a suffix of *[]* in its argument list accepts
an arbitrary number of arguments.
A more detailed procedure description follows the header line.

Some library procedures such as *printf*, *remove*, and *regex*
are just springboards to underlying Go functions.
These are indicated by a link on the header line to the Go function.
Additional documentation of associated types and methods
can be found by following the link.

Extracted descriptions may refer to the Go function and parameter names
rather than those of the intermediate Goaldi procedure.
In general, if any of these Go functions returns an error,
an exception is thrown.

Methods are distinguished from procedures by an inital character and period,
as in *L.put*(...).
The initial character indicates the type of value 
to which the method applies:
====
*x* {nbsp} any value +
*t* {nbsp} type value +
*f* {nbsp} file value +
*c* {nbsp} channel value +
*L* {nbsp} list value +
*S* {nbsp} set value +
*T* {nbsp} table value +

chdir(dir) -- change working directory [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/os#Chdir[os.Chdir])_::
Chdir changes the current working directory to the named directory. If there
is an error, it will be of type *PathError.

chmod(name,mode) -- change file mode [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/os#Chmod[os.Chmod])_::
Chmod changes the mode of the named file to mode. If the file is a symbolic
link, it changes the mode of the link's target. If there is an error, it
will be of type *PathError.
+
A different subset of the mode bits are used, depending on the operating
system.
+
On Unix, the mode's permission bits, ModeSetuid, ModeSetgid, and ModeSticky
are used.
+
On Windows, only the 0200 bit (owner writable) of mode is used; it controls
whether the file's read-only attribute is set or cleared. The other bits are
currently unused. For compatibility with Go 1.12 and earlier, use a non-zero
mode. Use mode 0400 for a read-only file and 0600 for a readable+writable
file.
+
On Plan 9, the mode's permission bits, ModeAppend, ModeExclusive, and
ModeTemporary are used.

clearenv() -- delete all environment variables [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/os#Clearenv[os.Clearenv])_::
Clearenv deletes all environment variables.

f.close() -- close file::
f.close() closes file f.

c.close() -- close channel::
c.close() closes the channel c.

command(name,args[]) -- build struct to run command [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/os/exec#Command[os/exec.Command])_::
Command returns the Cmd struct to execute the named program with the given
arguments.
+
It sets only the Path and Args in the returned structure.
+
If name contains no path separators, Command uses LookPath to resolve name
to a complete path if possible. Otherwise it uses name directly as Path.
+
The returned Cmd's Args field is constructed from the command name followed
by the elements of arg, so arg should not include the command name itself.
For example, Command("echo", "hello"). Args[0] is always name, not the
possibly resolved Path.
+
On Windows, processes receive the whole command line as a single string and
do their own parsing. Command combines and quotes Args into a command line
string with an algorithm compatible with applications using
CommandLineToArgvW (which is the most common way). Notable exceptions are
msiexec.exe and cmd.exe (and thus, all batch files), which have a different
unquoting algorithm. In these or other similar cases, you can do the quoting
yourself and provide the full command line in SysProcAttr.CmdLine, leaving
Args empty.

constructor(name,fields[]) -- build a record constructor::
constructor(name, field...) builds a record constructor for creating records
with the given type name and field list. There is no requirement or
guarantee that record names be distinct.

duration(x) -- convert value to a Go Duration struct::
duration(x) converts x to an external Go
http://golang.org/pkg/time#Duration[time.Duration] value. If x is a string,
it is passed directly to
http://golang.org/pkg/time#ParseDuration[time.ParseDuration()]. If x is a
number, "s" is appended to interpret it as an interval in seconds. If the
conversion is unsuccessful, duration() fails.

environ() -- get list of environment variables [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/os#Environ[os.Environ])_::
Environ returns a copy of strings representing the environment, in the form
"key=value".

equalfold(s,t) -- return 1 if s==t with case folding [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/strings#EqualFold[strings.EqualFold])_::
EqualFold reports whether s and t, interpreted as UTF-8 strings, are equal
under Unicode case-folding, which is a more general form of
case-insensitivity.

external(x) exports and then re-imports the value x.

x.external() -- export and re-import::
external(x) exports and then re-imports the value x.

fields(s) -- return fields of s delimited by whitespace [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/strings#Fields[strings.Fields])_::
Fields splits the string s around each instance of one or more consecutive
white space characters, as defined by unicode.IsSpace, returning a slice of
substrings of s or an empty slice if s contains only white space.

file(name,flags) -- open a file::
file(name,flags) opens a file and returns a file value.
+
Each character of the optional flags argument selects an option:
+
    "r"   open for reading
    "w"   open for writing
    "a"   open for appending
    "c"   create and open for writing
    "n"   no buffering
    "f"   fail on error (instead of panicking)
+
If none of "w", "a", or "c" are specified, then "r" is implied. "w" implies
"c" unless "r" is also specified. Buffering is used if "n" is absent and the
file is opened exclusively for reading or writing but not both.
+
In the absence of "f", any error throws an exception.

floor(n) -- round down to integer [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/math#Floor[math.Floor])_::
Floor returns the greatest integer value less than or equal to x.
+
Special cases are:
+
    Floor(±0) = ±0
    Floor(±Inf) = ±Inf
    Floor(NaN) = NaN

gcd(i,...) truncates its arguments to integer and returns their greatest
common divisor. Negative values are allowed. gcd() returns zero if all
values are zero.

f.get() -- read one line::
f.get() consumes and returns next line of text from file f. The trailing
linefeed or CRLF is removed from the returned value. f.get() fails at EOF
when no more data is available.

c.get() reads the next value from channel c, or fails if no value is
available.

L.get() -- remove from front::
L.get() removes the first element from list L and returns the element's
value.

getenv(key) -- read environment variable [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/os#Getenv[os.Getenv])_::
Getenv retrieves the value of the environment variable named by the key. It
returns the value, which will be empty if the variable is not present. To
distinguish between an empty value and an unset value, use LookupEnv.

getpid() -- get process ID [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/os#Getpid[os.Getpid])_::
Getpid returns the process id of the caller.

getppid() -- get parent process ID [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/os#Getppid[os.Getppid])_::
Getppid returns the process id of the caller's parent.

getwd() -- get working directory [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/os#Getwd[os.Getwd])_::

+
Special cases are:
+
    Trunc(±0) = ±0
    Trunc(±Inf) = ±Inf
    Trunc(NaN) = NaN

ior(i,j) -- compute bitwise OR::
ior(i, j) returns the bitwise OR of the values i and j truncated to integer.

ishift(i,j) -- compute bitwise shift of i by j::
ishift(i, j) shifts i by j bits and returns the result. If j > 0, the shift
is to the left with zero fill. If j < 0, the shift is to the right with sign
extension. The arguments are both truncated to integer before operating.

ixor(i,j) -- compute bitwise exclusive OR::

map(s,from,into) produces a new string that result from mapping the
individual characters of a source string. Each character of s that appears
in the "from" string is replaced by the corresponding character of the
"into" string. If there is no corresponding character, because "into" is
shorter, then the character from s is discarded.

max(n[]) -- find maximum value::
max(n, ...) returns the largest of its arguments.

mkdir(name,perm) -- create directory [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/os#Mkdir[os.Mkdir])_::
Mkdir creates a new directory with the specified name and permission bits
(before umask). If there is an error, it will be of type *PathError.

mkdirall(path,perm) -- create directory tree [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/os#MkdirAll[os.MkdirAll])_::
MkdirAll creates a directory named path, along with any necessary parents,
and returns nil, or else returns an error. The permission bits perm (before
umask) are used for all directories that MkdirAll creates. If path is
already a directory, MkdirAll does nothing and returns nil.

t.name() -- get type name::
t.name() returns the name of type t.

nilresult(e) -- return nil::
nilresult(e) returns nil, ignoring e. It is suitable for use as a catch
handler.

niltype() -- return nil value::
niltype() always returns the sole instance of the nil value. niltype is the
name of the result of nil.type().

noresult(e) -- fail immediately::
noresult(e) fails immediately, ignoring e. It is suitable for use as a catch
handler.

now() -- return the current instant as a Go Time struct::
now() returns the current time as an external Go
http://golang.org/pkg/time#Time[time.Time] value, which can then be
formatted or otherwise manipulated by calling
http://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Format[tval.Format()] or other associated
methods.

number(x) -- convert to number::
number(x) returns its argument converted to number, or fails if it cannot be
converted due to its form or datatype. For string (or stringable) arguments,
number() trims leading and trailing spaces and then accepts standard Go
decimal forms (fixed and floating) or Goaldi radix forms (101010b, 52o, 2Ax,
23r1J).

output. It returns the number of bytes written and any write error
encountered.

println(x[]) -- write line of values::
println(x,...) writes its arguments to %stdout, separated by spaces and
terminated by a newline character.

f.println(x[]) -- write line of values::
f.println(x,...) writes its arguments to file f, separated by spaces and
terminated by a newline character.

proctype(x) -- succeed if procedure::
proctype(x) returns x if x is a procedure, and fails otherwise. proctype is
the name of the result of main.type().

L.pull() removes the final element from list L and returns the element's
value.

L.push(x[]) -- add to front::
L.push(x...) adds its arguments, in order, to the beginning of list L. The
last argument thus ends up as the first element of L.

f.put(x[]) -- write values as lines::
f.put(x,...) writes its arguments to file f, each followed by a newline.
This treats a file as as a container of text values separated by newlines,
which is consistent with the interpretation used by f.get().

c.put(x) -- send to channel::
c.put(e...) writes its argument values, in order, to channel c.

L.put(x[]) -- add to end::
L.put(x...) adds its arguments, in order, to the end of list L. The last
argument becomes the final element of L.

arguments.

quote(s) -- add quotation marks and escapes to s [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/strconv#Quote[strconv.Quote])_::
Quote returns a double-quoted Go string literal representing s. The returned
string uses Go escape sequences (\t, \n, \xFF, \u0100) for control
characters and non-printable characters as defined by IsPrint.

randgen(seed) -- create independent random sequence::
randgen(i) returns a new random generator seeded by i. The returned external
value is a Go http://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/#Rand[math.rand/Rand] object
whose methods may be called from Goaldi to produce random values.

randomize() -- irreproducibly seed random generation::
randomize() seeds the random number generator with an irreproducible value
obtained from /dev/urandom.

read(f) -- read one line from a file::
read(f) consumes and returns next line of text from file f. The trailing
linefeed or CRLF is removed from the returned value. read() fails at EOF
when no more data is available.

f.read() -- read one line::
f.read() consumes and returns next line of text from file f. The trailing
linefeed or CRLF is removed from the returned value. f.read() fails at EOF
when no more data is available.

f.readb(size) -- read binary bytes::
f.readb(n) reads up to n bytes into individual characters without attempting
any UTF-8 decoding. This is useful for reading binary files. f.readb() fails
at EOF when no more data is available.

regex(expr) -- compile Go regular expression [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/regexp#Compile[regexp.Compile])_::
Compile parses a regular expression and returns, if successful, a Regexp
object that can be used to match against text.
+
When matching against text, the regexp returns a match that begins as early
as possible in the input (leftmost), and among those it chooses the one that
a backtracking search would have found first. This so-called leftmost-first
matching is the same semantics that Perl, Python, and other implementations
use, although this package implements it without the expense of
backtracking. For POSIX leftmost-longest matching, see CompilePOSIX.

regexp(expr) -- compile POSIX regular expression [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/regexp#CompilePOSIX[regexp.CompilePOSIX])_::
CompilePOSIX is like Compile but restricts the regular expression to POSIX
ERE (egrep) syntax and changes the match semantics to leftmost-longest.
+
That is, when matching against text, the regexp returns a match that begins
as early as possible in the input (leftmost), and among those it chooses a
match that is as long as possible. This so-called leftmost-longest matching
is the same semantics that early regular expression implementations used and
that POSIX specifies.
+
However, there can be multiple leftmost-longest matches, with different
submatch choices, and here this package diverges from POSIX. Among the
possible leftmost-longest matches, this package chooses the one that a
backtracking search would have found first, while POSIX specifies that the
match be chosen to maximize the length of the first subexpression, then the
second, and so on from left to right. The POSIX rule is computationally
prohibitive and not even well-defined. See
https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp2.html#posix for details.

remove(name) -- delete file [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/os#Remove[os.Remove])_::
Remove removes the named file or (empty) directory. If there is an error, it
will be of type *PathError.

rename(old,new) -- change file name [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/os#Rename[os.Rename])_::
Rename renames (moves) oldpath to newpath. If newpath already exists and is
not a directory, Rename replaces it. OS-specific restrictions may apply when
oldpath and newpath are in different directories. If there is an error, it
will be of type *LinkError.

repl(s,count) -- concatenate copies of s [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/strings#Repeat[strings.Repeat])_::
Repeat returns a new string consisting of count copies of the string s.
+
It panics if count is negative or if the result of (len(s) * count)
overflows.

replace(s,old,new) -- return s with new replacing old [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/strings#Replace[strings.Replace])_::
Replace returns a copy of the string s with the first n non-overlapping
instances of old replaced by new. If old is empty, it matches at the
beginning of the string and after each UTF-8 sequence, yielding up to k+1
replacements for a k-rune string. If n < 0, there is no limit on the number
of replacements.

reverse(s) -- return mirror image of string::
reverse(s) returns the end-for-end reversal of the string s.

right(s,w,p) -- right-justify with padding p to width w::
right(s,w,p) right-justifies s in a string of width w, padding with p.

rtod(r) -- convert radians to degrees::
rtod(r) returns the degree equivalent of the angle r given in radians.

seed(n) -- set random number seed [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/math/rand#Seed[math/rand.Seed])_::
Seed uses the provided seed value to initialize the default Source to a
deterministic state. If Seed is not called, the generator behaves as if
seeded by Seed(1). Seed values that have the same remainder when divided by
2³¹-1 generate the same pseudo-random sequence. Seed, unlike the Rand.Seed
method, is safe for concurrent use.

f.seek(n) -- set file position::
f.seek(n) sets the position for the next read or write on file f. File
positions are measured in bytes, not characters, counting the first byte as
1. A value of 0 seeks to end of file, and a negative value is an offset from
the end.

seq(n,incr) -- produce n to infinity::
seq(n,incr) generates an endless sequence of values beginning at n with
increments of incr.

sleep(n) -- pause execution momentarily::
sleep(n) delays execution for n seconds, which may be a fractional value. If
n is nil, sleep() blocks indefinitely.

L.sort(i) -- return sorted copy::
L.sort(i) returns a copy of list L in which the elements have been sorted.
Values are ordered first by type, then within types by their values. Among
lists and among records of the same type, ordering is based on field i.
Lists with no element i are sorted ahead of lists that have one. The value i
defaults to 1 and must be strictly positive.

S.sort(i) -- produce sorted list::
S.sort(i) returns a sorted list of the members of set S. This is equivalent
to [:!S:].sort(i).

T.sort(i) -- produce sorted list::
T.sort(i) returns a sorted list of elemtype(key,value) records holding the
contents of table T. Sorting is by key if i=1 and by value if i=2. T.sort(i)
is equivalent to [:!T:].sort(i).

split(s,sep) -- return fields delimited by sep [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/strings#Split[strings.Split])_::
Split slices s into all substrings separated by sep and returns a slice of
the substrings between those separators.
+
If s does not contain sep and sep is not empty, Split returns a slice of
length 1 whose only element is s.
+
If sep is empty, Split splits after each UTF-8 sequence. If both s and sep
are empty, Split returns an empty slice.
+
It is equivalent to SplitN with a count of -1.
+
To split around the first instance of a separator, see Cut.

sprintf(fmt,x[]) -- make string by formatting values [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/fmt#Sprintf[fmt.Sprintf])_::
Sprintf formats according to a format specifier and returns the resulting
string.

sqrt(n) -- compute square root [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/math#Sqrt[math.Sqrt])_::
Sqrt returns the square root of x.
+
Special cases are:
+
    Sqrt(+Inf) = +Inf
    Sqrt(±0) = ±0
    Sqrt(x < 0) = NaN
    Sqrt(NaN) = NaN

stop(x[]) -- write values and abort program::
stop(x,...) writes its arguments to %stderr and terminates execution with an
exit code of 1 (indicating an error).

string(x) -- render as string::
string(x) returns a string representation of x. The result is identical to
the value used by write(x) or sprintf("%v",x).

x.string() -- render value as string::
string(x) returns a string representation of x. The result is identical to
the value used by write(x) or sprintf("%v",x).

table(x) -- create a table with default value x::
table(x) creates a new, empty table having x as the default value.

tan(n) -- compute tangent [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/math#Tan[math.Tan])_::
Tan returns the tangent of the radian argument x.
+
Special cases are:
+
    Tan(±0) = ±0
    Tan(±Inf) = NaN
    Tan(NaN) = NaN

tanh(n) -- compute hyperbolic tangent [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/math#Tanh[math.Tanh])_::
Tanh returns the hyperbolic tangent of x.
+
Special cases are:
+
    Tanh(±0) = ±0
    Tanh(±Inf) = ±1
    Tanh(NaN) = NaN

throw(e,x[]) -- terminate with error and offending values::
throw(e, x...) raises an exception with error value e and zero or more
offending values. If not caught, the exception terminates execution.
+
If e is a number or string, a Goaldi exception is created using e.
Otherwise, the value e is thrown directly, without interpretation.

time() -- return the current time::
time() returns the current time of day in the form "hh:mm:ss".

tolower(s) -- convert to lower case [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/strings#ToLower[strings.ToLower])_::
ToLower returns s with all Unicode letters mapped to their lower case.

toupper(s) -- convert to upper case [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/strings#ToUpper[strings.ToUpper])_::
ToUpper returns s with all Unicode letters mapped to their upper case.

trim(s,cutset) -- remove leading and trailing characters [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/strings#Trim[strings.Trim])_::
Trim returns a slice of the string s with all leading and trailing Unicode
code points contained in cutset removed.

truncate(name,size) -- change file size [silver]_(http://golang.org/pkg/os#Truncate[os.Truncate])_::
Truncate changes the size of the named file. If the file is a symbolic link,
it changes the size of the link's target. If there is an error, it will be
of type *PathError.

tuple(id:e...) -- create anonymous record::
tuple(id:e, ...) creates an anonymous record value. Each argument must be
named. Each distinct identifier list defines a new type, all of which have
the name "tuple".

type(x) -- return type of value::
type(x) returns the value of type "type" that represents the type of x.

x.type() -- return type of value::
type(x) returns the value of type "type" that represents the type of x.

f.unbuffer() -- stop file buffering::
f.unbuffer() removes any buffering from file f. Any buffered output is
flushed; any buffered input is lost.

unquote(s) -- remove delimiters and escapes from s::
unquote(s) removes delimiters and escapes from a quoted string. The argument
s must begin and end with explicit "double quotes" or \`backticks`.
unquote() fails if s is not properly quoted or if it contains an invalid (by
Go rules) escape sequence.

f.where() -- report current file position::
f.where() reports the current position of file f. File positions are
measured in bytes, counting the first byte as 1.

write(x[]) -- write values and newline::
write(x,...) writes its arguments to %stdout followed by a newline.

f.write(x[]) -- write values and newline::
f.write(x,...) writes its arguments to file f followed by a single newline.

f.writeb(s) -- write binary bytes::
f.writeb(s) writes the string s to file f without any UTF-8 encoding.
Instead, the low 8 bits of each character are written as a single byte,
ignoring all other bits. This is useful for writing binary files.

writes(x[]) -- write values::
writes(x,...) write its arguments to %stdout with no following newline.

f.writes(x[]) -- write values::
f.writes(x,...) write its arguments to file f with no following newline.

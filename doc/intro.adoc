This is part of the documentation for
https://github.com/proebsting/goaldi#goaldi-a-goal-directed-programming-language[The Goaldi Programming Language].
Goaldi is a new general-purpose programming language that combines the
goal-directed evaluation model of the Icon language with modern features
such as concurrency, objects, and closures.  While Goaldi will look
familiar to Icon programmers, it is not upwards compatible, and it omits
some features of Icon.

Documentation is split among:

* link:intro.adoc[Goaldi Introduction] (this document)
* link:ref.adoc[Goaldi Language Reference]
* link:stdlib.adoc[Goaldi Library Reference]
* link:diffs.adoc[Goaldi for Icon Programmers]
* link:build.adoc[Goaldi Installation and Internals]

Goaldi is a file-based language without a GUI.  To run a Goaldi program,
create a source file and run it using a shell command:
----
goaldi filename.gd [arguments]
----

Goaldi is implemented using a front-end translator written in Goaldi
combined with a back-end interpreter written in http://golang.org/[Go].
The library is easily extensible by additional Go code.

The implementation can be downloaded (in source or binary form) from
https://github.com/proebsting/goaldi[github.com/proebsting/goaldi].

The name “Goaldi” is pronounced to rhyme with “moldy” (not “malady” or
“o’baldy”).


Goaldi Language Overview
------------------------

Goaldi is a high-level, general-purpose procedural language.  The syntax
is line-oriented with implicit semicolon insertion.

Goaldi is polymorphic:  Values have types (which may be inspected), but
variables are typeless and can hold any value.  Memory allocation and
garbage collection are automatic.
Data types include strings, numbers, channels, records (structs), lists,
sets, and tables.  Lists can function as arrays, stacks, queues, or
deques.

Goaldi draws heavily from the Icon programming language.
If you're unfamiliar with Icon, there is much information on the
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/[Icon website], including brief introductions
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/docs/ipd266.htm[by Ralph Griswold] or
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/intro.htm[by Dave Hanson].

Goaldi adds objects and methods, concurrency, closures, exception
handling, namespaces, dynamically scoped constants, structure
initialization, dependency-based global initialization, and Unicode
support; these are documented in the link:ref.adoc[Goaldi Language Reference].
Goaldi lacks Icon's string scanning and multi-precision integers.

Goaldi retains Icon's model of __goal-directed evaluation__, where under
the right circumstances an expression or procedure can produce zero,
one, or many results.

Goaldi is written in the https://golang.org/[Go] language and is easily
extended to interface with Go functions.


Some Examples
-------------

Hello, world
~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is traditional to begin a presentation of a programming language with
a program that writes something along the lines of “Hello, world”.  (One
of the authors comes from a family of editors and publishers, and
believes in the comma of direct address.)

The simplest form is this:

----
procedure main() {
    write("Hello, world")
}
----

When run, it outputs a constant string.

Let’s make it a little more flexible.  If any names are given on the
command line, this enhanced version will greet them by name;  if not, it
will again write a fixed string.

----
procedure main(args[]) {
    if *args > 0 then {
        while local name := args.get() do {
            write("Hello, ", name)
        }
    } else {
        write("Hello, world")
    }
}
----

The args[] parameter declaration says that this is a _variadic_
procedure accepting any number of values, which form a _list_ named
args.  For the main procedure, the arguments are those from the command
line:  **goaldi hello.gd Homer**  writes  *Hello, Homer*  on standard
output.  Note that **local name** both declares a variable and serves as a
component of a larger expression.

**args.get()** is a list method that removes and returns the first item
of a list.  When the list is empty, the method _fails_, which
terminates the *every* loop.  Failure is not a value like _true_ or
_false_ but instead an out-of-band signal that no value is available.
Because this signal propagates, the local variable can be eliminated:

----
procedure main(args[]) {
    if *args > 0 then {
        while write("Hello, ", args.get())
    } else {
        write("Hello, world")
    }
}
----

Now the *get* method call is enclosed directly in the *write* call.
When the method fails, the enclosing *write* expression fails, and so
the *while* loop terminates.

The *get* operation is common enough that it can be replaced by an
**@** operator:

----
procedure main(args[]) {
    if *args > 0 then {
        while write("Hello, ", @args)
    } else {
        write("Hello, world")
    }
}
----

As an alternative to consuming the list, we can iterate through it using
a _generator_.  A generator is an expression that produces a sequence
of values;  **1 to 10**  is a simple generator that produces ten
integers.  The unary **!** operator generates the contents of a list and
can be used like this:

----
procedure main(args[]) {
    if *args > 0 then {
        every write("Hello, ", !args)
    } else {
        write("Hello, world")
    }
}
----

Note that not only has the **@** operator been replaced by *!* but also
the *while* loop is now an *every* loop.  The subtle but critical
difference is that *while* evaluates its argument expression
repeatedly; *every* initiates it just once but drives it to produce
all its results.

Finally, consider the original goal of printing arguments if there were
any or using “world” if not.  Goaldi has an operator for this.  In the
expression **x ~| y**, the **~|** operator produces the values of the
subexpression *x*; but if *x* fails immediately without producing
results, it instead produces the values of the subexpression *y*.  It
turns out that this is exactly what we need:

----
procedure main(args[]) {
    every write("Hello, ", !args ~| "world")
}
----

Word Counting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This simple program counts the occurrences of distinct words in a text
file.  It leverages the Go library’s regular expression package to
extract the words.  A word is defined to be one or more consecutive
Unicode letters, so “Camille Saint-Saëns” is three words.

----
procedure main(filename) {
    local f := file(\filename) | %stdin
    local words := table(0)
    local rx := regex(`\pL+`)
    while local line := f.read() do {
        local matches := rx.FindAllString(line, -1)
        every local w := !\matches do {
            words[w] +:= 1
        }
    }
    every local kv := !words.sort() do
        printf("%6.0f  %s\n", kv.value, kv.key)
}
----

The *file* call opens the file specified as a command-line argument; if
none was given, *filename* is nil, **\filename** fails, and so
standard input is used instead.

*words* is a table in which the initial value of every element is set
to zero for use as a counter.

*rx* is initialized to a compiled regular expression, which is an
*external* (Go) type to Goaldi.

The *while* loop repeatedly calls *read* until the call fails at
EOF.  For each line, *FindAllString* returns a list of words, or
*nil* if the line had none.  This is a direct call of a Go object
method from Goaldi.

The inner *every* loop iterates through the words of the line,
provided (by the **\matches** test) that *FindAllString* did not
return nil.  For each word, the corresponding table entry is incremented
by one.

The final *every* loop prints the results.  **words.sort()** returns a
list of key/value pairs, each of which is in turn assigned to *kv*.
Each one is then printed using Go’s *printf* function to format the
results.

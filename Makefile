#  Goaldi Makefile
#
#  ASSUMPTIONS:
#
#  (1) Go is installed and in the search path, and $GOPATH is set properly.
#      IF NOT: Install Go before proceeding, and set $GOPATH.
#
#  (2) A functioning "goaldi" executable is in the search path.
#      IF NOT: Remove any nonfunctional goaldi executable from the path.
#      Then run "make boot" in a clean, unedited release package to build
#      and install in $GOPATH/bin from a stable intermediate snapshot.
#
#  (3) Any intermediate build products are functional and mutually compatible.
#      IF NOT: Run "make clean" to remove them after a failed build
#      or after making incompatible changes to the intermediate representation.
